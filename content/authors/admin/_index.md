<h2> Biography</h2>
My name is Ilgee Hong and I am a second-year master student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago where I am lucky to be advised by [Prof. Claire Donnat](https://donnate.github.io/) and co-advised by [Prof. Mladen Kolar](https://mkolar.coffeejunkies.org/) and Dr. Sen Na. 

In summer 2022, I worked as a visiting intern in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego under the supervision of [Prof. Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/index.html). 

I received bachelor's degrees in Applied Statistics at Yonsei University in 2020. During my senior year at the college, I also worked with Prof. Sangun Park.

I am broadly interested in machine learning and currently studying machine learning for graph-structured data and stochastic optimization.
