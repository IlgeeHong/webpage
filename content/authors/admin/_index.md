Hello! My name is Ilgee Hong and I am a second-year master student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago where I am advised by [Prof. Claire Donnat](https://donnate.github.io/) and [Prof. Mladen Kolar](https://mkolar.coffeejunkies.org/). Also, I am working as a visiting intern in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego where I am advised by [Prof. Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/index.html). I am broadly interested in machine learning and currently studying machine learning for graph data and randomized non-convex optimization.
